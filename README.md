# Image Segmentation, Clustering, Morphological Image Processing

Each folder in this Repo has a main.py file, Images folder, Results folder and a .pdf report describing the Python program. Each folder represents an individual program and has been appropriately named to identify its application. Note that all programs have been written using Python and Numpy (without OpenCV or other CV libraries - with the exception of reading or writing Images).
